 <h2>Introduction</h2> 
 <!-- Main Content -->
 	<p>Electronic sports (or esports) is a term for organized video game competitions, especially between professionals. The most common video game genres associated with electronic sports are real-time strategy, fighting, first-person shooter, and multiplayer online battle arena. Tournaments such as the World Cyber Games, the Evolution Championship Series, and the Intel Extreme Masters provide both live broadcasts of the competition, and cash prizes to competitors

Although esports have long been a part of video game culture, competitions have seen a large surge in popularity in recent years. While competitions before around the year 2000 were largely between amateurs, the proliferation of professional competitions and growing viewership now supports a significant number of professional players and teams,[1] and many video game developers now build features into their games designed to facilitate such competition.

Historically, esports has appealed to a small niche audience, with little representation in mass media such as television. Because of this, the increasing availability of online video streaming platforms, particularly Twitch, has become central to current esports competitions.[2] Presently, the most popular titles featured in professional competition are League of Legends, Dota 2, and StarCraft II, but historical turnover in games' popularity implies this situation may change quickly.</p>

		<h2>Tournaments</h2>
	<p>esports tournaments are almost always physical events in which occur in front of a live audience. The tournament may be part of a larger gathering, such as Dreamhack, or the competition may be the entirety of the event, like the World Cyber Games. Competitions take several formats, but the most common are single or double elimination, sometimes hybridized with group stage. Competitions usually have referees or officials to monitor for cheating.[49]

Although competitions involving video games have long existed, esports underwent a significant transition in the late 1990s. Beginning with the Cyberathlete Professional League in 1997, tournaments became much larger, and corporate sponsorship became more common. Increasing viewership both in pesron and online brought esports to a wider audience.[1][50] Major tournaments include the World Cyber Games, the North American Major League Gaming league, the France based Electronic Sports World Cup, and the World e-Sports Games currently held in Hangzhou, China.

For well established games, total prize money can amount to millions of dollars a year.[51][52] Often, game developers provide prize money for tournament competition directly,[51] but sponsorship may also come from third parties, such as companies selling computer hardware, energy drinks, or computer software. Generally, hosting a large esports event is not profitable as a stand alone venture.[53] For example, Riot has stated that their headline League of Legends Championship series is "a significant investment that we're not making money from".[54]

There is considerable variation and negotiation over the relationship between video game developers and tournament organizers and broadcasters. While the original StarCraft events emerged in South Korea largely independently of Blizzard, the company decided to require organizers and broadcasters to authorize events featuring the sequel StarCraft II.[55] In the short term, this lead to a deadlock with the Korean e-Sports Association.[56] Ultimately, an agreement was reached in 2012.[57] Currently, Blizzard requires authorization for tournaments with more than $10,000 USD in prizes.[58] Riot Games offers in-game rewards to authorized tournaments.</p>
